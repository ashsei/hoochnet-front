## Introduction and User Stories
Welcome to HoochNet! Short for Hooch Cabinet, this web application retrieves cocktail recipes from The Cocktail DB API, and allows user to build an online liquor cabinet that recommends cocktail recipes based on selected ingredients. There is also functionality to see the 20 most popular recipes, and 10 random recipes.

## Approach
I first broke this project down on a wireframe detailing the pathing and features of the application:

I then broke this down into components on a Trello board:

As the project progressed and evolved I wrote manual to be done lists at the beginning of each working day.


## Technologies Used
### Full Stack Application Utilizing the Following Structures and Technologies:
- MERN Stack (Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js)
- CRUD Routing for Models (Within Backend)
- User Authentication Via Auth0
- Cocktail DB API Integration
- Axios API Calls
- React Hooks


## Known Bugs
- Styling Issues (Mainly revolving around media based styling)
- Sometimes when the live search field is empty, results will still start.
- Need to get rid of randomize button on popular page.
- Some searches based on selected ingredients don't return correct results (not sure if this is stemming from the application or from the API)

## Forward Thoughts
- Be able to allow users to bookmark/favorite their favorite recipes.
- Cocktail DB allows entries to the DB from the public, so integrating this functionality would be nice.
- Will probably restyle, to be more user friendly.
- Would like to apply a CSS framework.
